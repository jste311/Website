<h1><b><u>Rube Goldburg Build</u></b></h1>
<p>This week we worked on actually building our machine based off of the CAD we 
did. After laying down the base, we started to work on the large ramp ar the start.
We faced first faced challenges when finding a way to support the ramp and when finding a way
for the ramp to hold its slope. Our solution was to use skewers to stab through 
the slope and the supports in order to hold it up. </p>
