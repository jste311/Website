    <h3><center>Challenge Description</center></h3>
        <p>
            One thing we focused on when learning about chemical engineering was non newtonain fluids. A non newtonain fluid is a fluid that doesn't follow Newtons laws of viscosity, meaning these fluids can change when sheer forces are applied. One of the most popular non newtonain fluids is a substance called oobleck. Oobleck is a substance famous for its change to a solid when subjected to sheer forces. Part of it's popularity comes from how easy it is to make, only needing corn starch and water at the right ratio. We were not given this ratio however. Our goal for this challenge was to figure the ratio needed to make oobleck that behaved like non newtonain fluid.

            For this challenge we were allowed one partner and we were given a cup of corn starch and a cup of water along with a container to mix in. Finding the ratio was fairly easy. We figured it was best to pour all the corn starch and just add water until we got the substance we wanted. After doing so the final ration ended up being something like 1 cup of cornstarch to about 3/4 cup of water. This ratio gave us a good consistancy and we were the first group to finish this project.

            Overall this project was pretty fun. It was much shorter than other units and projects, being only one class period, but it was still enjoyable. I liked having these shorter, experiment-like labs that provided a break from the usual work flow we have for most projects.
