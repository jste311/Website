    <h3><center>Project Run Down</center></h3>
        <p>
            The project for this unit was to, similarly to a Shark Tank Pitch, create and propose a business idea to Mr. Kim and the rest of the class. We had to both think of a product and create a slidshow presentation for it. But before we could do any of that, we had to think of an idea. 
        </p>
    <h3><center>Brainstorming</center></h3>
        <p>
            This part of the design process is probably what took the most work and thinking. My partner and I went thorugh a lot of potential ideas. Our first idea was toothbrush that did a lot more for your morning routine than a normal toothbrush. Another idea we had was "Common Sense Juice", which was a substance that could give someone the ability to use their brain more than 10%. But the idea that we finally decided on was something called "I-Memories".

    <h3>I-Memeories</h3>
        <p>
            The point of our product was to give people a way to keep and preserve their memeories for years to come. We sold a pair of glasses fitted with technology that could record and store memories. Our intended audience was people with memory related dieseases, we wanted to give them an opportunity to relive their best moments. Overall this project was pretty fun and I enjoyed creating our product.
