  <li>The heaviest part of our bridge was probably near the center. The middle of our bridge had more support beams than the end points, and also more glue. I think the glue probably contributed to most of the center weight since the noodles used in the center were not fully sized.</li>
  <li>The design of our bridge came from a couple different sources. The idea for using triangles came from looking at real-life bridges. A lot of bridges that use the warren design are very stable and have good strength to weight ratios. We got the idea for having the triangles cross over the two sides of the bridge from looking at truss bridges.</li>
  <li>Our design did work as intended, meaning it held up some weight. The design actually worked alot better than we expected. We figured the bridge would only hold 1/2 a cup, 1 cup maximum. Our estimations were completly off as our bridge completly exceded our expectations. Our bridge managed to hold a lot of water and we even got to the point where we needed the big bucket. </li>
  <li>The point where the bridge broke was near the end points. What happend was a part of the side beams came loose from the glue holding it, causing it to fall, and lead to a butterfly effect that took the bridge with it. This was not expected to happen. We did figure the end points would be the weakest but we did not think the glue would be the reason.</li>
  <li>In my opinion the best way we could imporve our bridge is fixing our gluing method. Because of the way our bridge had to be bult, it was very hard to set the liquid wood glue into a good position, and have it stay there. We resorted to using tape to hold the triangles in place while the glue dried, but this lead to some of the triangles being crooked. If we could find a better way to glue and keep the triangles up, the supports would have been a lot stronger.  </li>
