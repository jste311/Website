    <h3><center>Project Description</center></h3>
        <p>
            This project was unique to all previous prjects in this class for a few reasons. Firstly this was by far the longest we have spent on a project, around 5-6 weeks was spent on the whole process. Secondly this was the first project in which we had a choise on what we wanted to make. We were allowed to choose between making an arduino controlled motorized car, or a mouse trap powered car. Finaly this was the mosdt in depth project we've ever done. We even had to create a well written project proposal, which you can find <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lmeOPYuJEoZfXea6gdkrflHmR4pgz-apFOombVmkL4s/edit">here</a> beofre we could even CAD our design.

    <h3><center>Why a Mouse Trap Car?</center></h3>
        <p>
            When it was time to make a decision between the arduino car or the mouse trap car me, and my parter David, were able to quickly make a decision. We chose the mouse trap car for a few reasons. The first was because neihter of us were particularly fond of the eltrical engineering unit, and this project would require a lot of electrical compnents. While I do enjoy computer programing, my parter and I both opted for the mouse trap car due to our shared interest in the mechanical engineering needed principles for this porject.

    <h3><center>Design Idea</center></h3>
        <p>
            This project, like a few others, would have two interations. The point of this was to create and test one design in order to imporve upon it later. Our original idea for this car was to follow the "traditional" design of a mouse trap car, but with a twist. The difference in our car was going to be an added wheel in the center of the car that served as a secondary pulley system. More about this ideas as well as the impliations of it can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lmeOPYuJEoZfXea6gdkrflHmR4pgz-apFOombVmkL4s/edit">here</a>. After getting our project proposal approved, we started on designing our car. We got some measurements and created a CAD of our car.

        <p>
            The original plan was for this additional wheel to be part of our first interation, but due to time contraints, we couldn't add it in time and we had to fit it into our second iteration.

    <h3><center>Building Process</center></h3>
        <p>
            As mentioned before, this project had much more time than others. We had about 3 weeks to design our first interation. My partner and I capitalized off this extra time and tried to make the best car possible. The first thing we built was the main body of the car. This was pretty easy because he already had a design and all of the measurements needed. All that was needed was cutting up the cardboard. Once we had the body we used hot glue to attach the mouse trap to it. Second, we decided to work on the wheels. The wheels, front and back, were gonna use thr same design, CDs for wheels and skewers for the axels. We attached the skewers to the CDs but we had a problem when attaching it to the body. If we just put the skewers through hols in the body, there would be a lot of friction and the wheels would not rotate smoothly. Our solution was to use straws. The straws acted as sort of a holder for the axel that allowed for unrestricted rotation of the wheels. Finally we built the arm. The arm was built out of skewers that we doubled up for both length and strength. We then attached the string, wraped it around the back axel, and our car was ready to go.

    <h3><center>Final</center></h3>
        <p>
            In the video below our car traveled 81 feet, and this distance was similar in all other trials. On the day we tested the car ours went the farthest out of all the others. We were unfortunatly unable to get a video from testing day but its performance then is similar to the trail video below.
