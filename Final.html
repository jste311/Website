    <h3><center>Project Description</center></h3>
        <p>
            We were told that our final project was to mcnstruct a boat using only cardboard and duct tape. This boat had to fit two people and to one end of the CV pool and back. We were given a very long time to work on this project and, like the mouse trap car project, we had to create a project description and analysis. This analysis document also contains details like research, calculations, and project results and can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP_yFAh-aPG14VhGoOxwcbgveSYkwbhTF2xYNtwswPI/edit#heading=h.o7d4n3875tk9">here</a>
        </p>
    <h3><center>Boat Design</center></h3>
        <p>
            As with all other projects, we started by creating a basic sketch and then making a CAD using TinkerCAD. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP_yFAh-aPG14VhGoOxwcbgveSYkwbhTF2xYNtwswPI/edit#heading=h.o7d4n3875tk9">Our CAD</a> has a few points of interest. The first is the two-layer base of the boat (The top layer is clear to show the inside). This two-layer base served two purposes, to provide additional bouyancy, and to add weight bearing strength. The decond node of interest is the triangular ends of the boat. This design choise was inspired by boats in the real world. Boats often feature these ends to "cut" through the water and make travel more efficient. For more detail about our design as well as flaws and concerns, refer to our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iP_yFAh-aPG14VhGoOxwcbgveSYkwbhTF2xYNtwswPI/edit">project analysis.</a>

    <h3><center>Building Process</center></h3>
        <p>
            The building process was by far the must fun part of this project. Within our group of four we decided to split into twos to work on two different things. David and I worked on the boat itself while Aiden and Andres worked on the oars. The fisrt step in building the boat was getting measurements. After that we began cutting the carboard. We decided to get all the pieces we needed first and then assemble all together rather than building as we got pieces. We didn't encounter many obstacles while building aprt form a few issues when making the base supports. After putting all parts of out boat together, as we calculated, we had a lot of extra tape to work with. We used this extra tape to reinforce weak areas and create a layer of tape on the bottom of the base. Our final boat looked very similar to our inicial design. The few minor changes we made to the design throughout the building process are discussed in the projects analysis mentioned above.

    <h3><center>Testing Day</center></h3>
        <p>
            When it came time to test all the boats we moved our boat down to the pool and we got ready to start. At first our boat was fine. it was able to float level no one in it. When out first memeber sat down the boat still remained level. However, when our second memeber sat in the boat, it became extremely back-heavy, but still floating. The coordination between the people in the boat was not great. They began paddling out of sync and ended up turning the boat and dropping the oars. They then begain spalishing and tipping in an attmpt to move forward.  This in combination with the lowered back side of the boat, lead to water splashing into the boat, slowly causing ot it sink. The boat made it to one end of the pool before fully sinking. Below is the video of our test.

    <h3><center>Final thoughts</center></h3>
        <p>
            Despite not making all the way back across the I think our boat did well. It didn't sink due to poor design rather due to poor coordination. Regardless, this project was very fun and a great way to wrap the year. I am going to miss this class and I look forward to watching next years boat projects.
