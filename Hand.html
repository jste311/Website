    <h2>Final build</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike the rube goldberg project, we didn't have to create a CAD for our design for the project. Because of that, me and my partner immeditaly began working on building our final product. After a bit of brainstorming we decided that our fingers would work by having both a rubber band and a string attached to them. Pulling on the string would cause tension in the rubber band and upon releasing the string, the finger would snap back to its original position. By this time we were running out of class time so for a very janky thumb design we, profesionally, stabed a skewer through our hand to act as a thumb. Since we were out of time we were unable to make more fingers, but one finger was enough for out hand to lift the bottle
