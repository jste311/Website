            The goal of this project was to make a design that had at least three simple machines that came together to pop a balloon at the end. Our first simple machine was a large ramp that we would push a baseball (blue sphere) down. After coming of the ramp the ball would land and go through a funnel (purple). The baseball would then land in one half of a pulley system causing the other side to raise up a hot wheel car. This car had a needle attached to it and after being lifted would be guided along down another ramp into the balloon (green)

    <h2>Building Process</h2>

            The building process of our machine had a few challenges. The first was trying to build the large ramp at the start. We had problems supporting the largestructure as well as keeping the shape of the ramp. Evetually we used wooden skewers to hold it up and it worked great. The second issue was figuring our the pulley. After a lot of trial and error we eventuall got it to work with a decent sucsses rate. The rest of the build was realativily straight foward, and after a few test runs, we were ready for the final demonstartion.
