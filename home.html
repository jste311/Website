The goal of this project was to make a design that had at least three simple machines that came together to pop a balloon at the end. Our first simple machine was a large ramp that we would push a baseball (blue sphere) down. After coming of the ramp the ball would land and go through a funnel (purple). The baseball would then land in one half of a pulley system causing the other side to raise up a hot wheel car. This car had a needle attached to it and after being lifted would be guided along down another ramp into the balloon (green)
