    <hr4><center><b>CAD, Design Process</b></center></hr4>
        <p>
            I started this porject weith just one other person, David Hovsepian, but due to a lack of 2-liter bottles, we joined a group of 4. The 6 of us then decided on which CAD to use (see below). We decided on a design that worked similarly to NASA space shuttles. We hoped that after its initial launch it would be able to glide for a little bit in the air. Our final CAD can be seen bellow.

        <p>
            The build for this prject was quite simple. First we cut a circle out of cardboard and bent it into the shape of the cone on top of the rocket. We then wraped out bottle in paper for two reasons, to add some very artistic designs, and as a place to attach the fins. The fins were hot glued on and the cone, with suprisingly little glue and tape, was able to attach easily. Alex then drew the skull and we were finished.

     <p>
         We actually launched our rocket twice. The first time did'nt count becuase Mr.Kim "acidentally" spilled all the water. Our second lauch was pretty good, however, it didn't glide as we hoped. Launch day was very fun though. Watching everyone launch their rockets and almost get hit by them was very fun and I would love to do more things like this.
