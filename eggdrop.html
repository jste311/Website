    <h3><center>Building Process</center></h3>
        <p> 
            Our idea for this project was to make a a container amde out of straws that would hold the egg. The idea behind this was that putting the egg in the middle would make it so that any force that went through the strwas would not reach the egg Since our design was very simple, the building was too. We only needed a few straws, tape, and some hot glue, to make our pyramid-like design. Because we had some extra time, we decided to add a simple parachute made of a trash bag attached by strings. The ideas behind that was, hopefull the bag would help reduce the contact forces. 
        </p>
    <h3><center>Testing</center></h3>
        <p>
            When testing day rolled around we were given a little more time to work on our project before we dropped them. But since we finished ours so quickly, we helped Mr. Kim set up the area where we would be dropping the eggs. We had to set up a makeshift tarp out of trasbags so that the egg splats wouldn't stain the ground. When it came time to test our design, it didn't work. None of the straws broke but what went wrong was that the egg slipped out of the container which caused it to hit the ground unprotected. Despite our design not working as we had hoped, I still had fun with this project and watching the other designs, pass or fail, was fun.
