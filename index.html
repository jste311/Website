            <p>
                Today in class we played a game named marble pass, where the goal was to move a marble from person to person using a seris of pipes. The rules for the game were as follows: No overlapping pipes, and every person in each group must be holding a pipe. After a lot of trial and error, our group finally figuired it out and got the marble into the bucket. This game was a very fun challenge and and I would love to do more activites like this in class.

                Since today was a short banking day, we only did one thing. Mr.Kim gave us a presantation of the basics of mechanical engineering. We learned about things like simple machines as well as the application of mechanical engineering in different fields. Thats was it for today, we have a quiz coming soon.

                Today we continued learning about mechanical engineering. We mainly focused on the practice of making a 3D model, or CAD, of whatever you are trying to build. This beneficial to the engineerign field because it allow you to get a visual of what you're making, as well as allowing to prototype and make changes without using real resources and money. We then practiced doing this by using a free sofware called, TinkerCAD. After learning how to use it, we had a competition to see who could model the best home appliance. I endeed up coming in second with my amzingly spectacular, awsome, unbranded oven.

                Today we started our Computaer science unit. For this unit we disected a computer. We tooka thje computer apart and learned about the different parts and what they did. We then learned how to put it back together. After reassembling it we powered it on and it worked great. It was very fun and interesting to leanr about and take aprt a computer. 10/10 would try again.

        <h4><b><center>Bioengineering Hand Project 10-6-23</center></b></h4>
            <p>
                This week we started our bioengoneering unit. We had a presentation about the this field and we learned what its all about. Our project for this unit was to, like a bioengineer, design and buld a prosthetic hand that could pick up and put down an empty water bottle. For more information about this project click this <a href="Hand.html">link</a>.
