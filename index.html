        <br>
        <p>Today in class me and my tablemates first drew out design ideas for our machine. After we each had our own designs drawn up, we then compared our designs and picked out the best features from each one in order to make a design we all agreed upon. After drawing up our final design we then logged into CAD and began to 3D model our ideas. here is a <a href="home.html">link</a> to pictures as well as more information about the CAD</p>
