                Today in class we played a game named marble pass, where the goal was to move a marble from person to person using a seris of pipes. The rules for the game were as follows: No overlapping pipes, and every person in each group must be holding a pipe. After a lot of trial and error, our group finally figuired it out and got the marble into the bucket. This game was a very fun challenge and and I would love to do more activites like this in class.

                Since today was a short banking day, we only did one thing. Mr.Kim gave us a presantation of the basics of mechanical engineering. We learned about things like simple machines as well as the application of mechanical engineering in different fields. Thats was it for today, we have a quiz coming soon.

                Today we continued learning about mechanical engineering. We mainly focused on the practice of making a 3D model, or CAD, of whatever you are trying to build. This beneficial to the engineering field because it allows you to get a visual of what you're making, as well as allowing you to prototype and make changes without using real resources and money. We then practiced doing this by using a free sofware called, TinkerCAD. After learning how to use it, we had a competition to see who could model the best home appliance. I ended up coming in second with my amzingly spectacular, awsome, unbranded oven.

                This week we were assigned the Rube Goldberg project. For this project me and my tablemates had to design and build our own contraption that completed a specific goal. Click this <a href="home.html">link</a> for more information about this project

                Today we started our Computaer science unit. For this unit we disected a computer. We took the computer apart and learned about the different parts and what they did. We then learned how to put it back together. After reassembling it we powered it on and it worked great. It was very fun and interesting to learned about and take apart a computer. 10/10 would try again.

                This week we started our bioengoneering unit. We had a presentation about the this field and we learned what it's all about. Our project for this unit was to, like a bioengineer, design and buld a prosthetic hand that could pick up and put down an empty water bottle.

            <p>
                This week we learned the basics of aerospace enginering. I was very excited for this unit since my goal is to become an aerospace engineer in the future. After the presentation we were given our next project. We were tasked with building a bottle rocket that went as high and far as possible. click this <a href="Rocket.html">link</a> for more information

               Today we strated ou environmental engineering unit. We learned the basics of this field of engineering. We spent a long time talking about things like water filtration. We learned about all of the processes invlved in water treatment. It was pretty interesting since I never thought that much went into water filtration. We also learned about how envionmental engineers focus on reducing polution. We talked about how many compnies are planning to use renewable engery. Overall this unit seems interesting and i'm excited for our project.
