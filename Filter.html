        <p>
            Before we could filter the water, we had to build the actual filter first. We decided it was best to go from filtering the bigger particles then to filtering smaller particles. We figured the order should be, rocks, pebbles, sand, and then cotton balls. The components are difficult to se in the picture but the rocks are on top and cotton on the very bottom.

        <p>
            The picture below is the result of passing the dirty water through our filter 2 times. Our filter worked suprisingly well on the first run through and by the 3rd filtering, the water was pretty clear. Probably still not a great idea to drink though.
