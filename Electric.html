            The first thing we did for this unit was use Tinker CADs built-in electrical engineering section. On Tinker CAD we made very basic circuits. We learned how to make both parralel and seris circuits and we also did a worksheet revolving around ohms law. Tinker CADS' interface was very easy to use and it was pretty fun making simple circuits with this software.

            After learning the basics in Tinker CAD, we moved on to making real circuits. Each group was given a breadboard, an arduino, and a box of wires, resistors, and LEDs. Below are pictures/videos of the circuits we made and some information about them
