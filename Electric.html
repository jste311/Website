    <h2><center>CAD Circuits</center></h2>
        <p>
            The first thing we did for this unit was use Tinker CADs built-in electrical engineering section. On Tinker CAD we made very basic circuits. We learned how to make both parralel and seris circuits and we also did a worksheet revolving around ohms law. Tinker CADS' interface was very easy to use and it was pretty fun making simple circuits with this software.

    <h2><center>Physical Circuits</center></h2>
        <p>
            After learning the basics in Tinker CAD, we moved on to making real circuits. Each group was given a breadboard, an arduino, and a box of wires, resistors, and LEDs. Below are pictures/videos of the circuits we made and some information about them
        </p>
    <h3><center>Blinking LED</center></h3>
        <center><video width="523" height="378" controls="" loop=""><source src = "IMG_5327.MOV" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
        <p>This was the first arduino controlled LED circuit we made. Since this was a reletivly easy and simple circuit, it didn't take long to make. Most of the time was spent setting up the arduino and programing the blinking sequence. </p>
    <h3><center>Fading LED</center></h3>
        <center><video width="523" height="378" controls="" loop=""><source src = "IMG_5331.MOV" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
        <p>This Circuit was a little more complicated to create. Once again the actual physical circuit was fairly easy, as it contained one LED. The difficulty came from programing the arduino. The code for this was a little more complicated than the blinking but eventually, my partner and I got it working</p>
    <h3><center>Pattern LEDs</center></h3>
        <center><video width="523" height="378" controls="" loop=""><source src = "IMG_5330.MOV" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
        <center><video width="523" height="378" controls="" loop=""><source src = "IMG_5329.MOV" type="video/mp4"></video></center>
        <p>The last of the arduino based circuits we made are these cool pattern sequences. For this we were given a pattern to recreate using the LEDs but we still had to make the circuit and program the arduino ourselves. The circuit for these was a little more complicated as it contained more LEDs as well as some resistors. Programing the arduino was fairly easy as we had already gotten used to the syntax and coding the pattern wasn't too difficult.. </p>
